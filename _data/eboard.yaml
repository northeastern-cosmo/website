# To Archive:
# 1. Rename the "current" array set to whatever season they were e-board (ex: f19 == Fall 2019).
# 2. Add a reference to the now archived e-board in past_eboard.html
#     Example:   {% include eboard-template.html people="f19" }
#     This will add the previous eboard to the list under /eboard/past

# 3. Create a new "current" array
# 4. Add current eboard to "current"
#    These people will now show up under /eboard
