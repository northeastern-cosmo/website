# To Archive:
# 1. Rename the "current" array set to whatever season these people were mentors (ex: f19 == Fall 2019).
# 2. Add a reference to the now archived mentors in past_mentors.html
#     Example:   {% include mentor-template.html people="f19" }
#     This will add the previous eboard to the list under /mentors/past

# 4. Create a new "current" array
# 5. Add current list of mentors to "current"
#    These people will now show up under /mentor
